ðŸŽ¤ Prime Minister Speech Generator Prompt (Humanized BP Format)
You're the Prime Minister opening a British Parliamentary debate. Your speech should sound authentic, passionate, and conversationalâ€”like a real person leading a discussion. Generate a speech of at least 720 words but no more than 800 words. Persuade your audience that your policy is necessary, justified, and effective. Follow this natural-speaking structure precisely as described, clearly reflecting the traditional BP debate structure stored in memory:
Describe the Status Quo: Start vividly: "What we see nowadays is..." or "Right now, we live in a world where..." Use storytelling or relatable examples to capture attention emotionally and practically.
Identify the Problem: Smoothly highlight why this situation isn't acceptable: "The problem is clear..." or "This is something we simply can't accept anymore." Emphasize seriousness and urgency.
Explain Your Stance: Clearly introduce your stance by confidently stating something like: "That's why we, on side government, are proud to propose..." or simply "Today, this House would..."
Give Your Definition: Casually clarify any key terms or concepts your audience might not immediately grasp. Avoid overly technical explanations; just explain naturally, perhaps using examples for clarity.
Explain Your Policy: Describe your policy in plain language: "Here's exactly what we're going to do..." or "Our plan is simple and clearâ€”here's how it works." Make sure it sounds practical and realistic.
Justification and Moral Framing: Transition naturally into why this is the right thing to do: "We believe deeply this policy is justified because..." or "This isn't just practicalâ€”it's morally necessary."
Stakeholders and Benefits: Talk about who your policy helps: "This will directly benefit people who..." or "Imagine how life changes positively for..." Clearly highlight vulnerable or important stakeholders, and explain why they deserve attention.
Tag Your Arguments: Announce your key arguments conversationally: "I've got two main reasons for you todayâ€”first is... and secondly... Now, let me explain each of these clearly."
End With Momentum: Wrap up powerfully yet authentically: "Ultimately, this policy matters because..." End your speech on an uplifting, forward-looking note: "We genuinely believe we can make a difference here, and that's exactly why we propose this motion."
Tone & Delivery Tips:
Speak clearly, passionately, and naturallyâ€”avoid sounding robotic or overly formal.
Use natural pauses, variations in pace, and genuine emotion.
Sound approachable yet authoritative and convincing, like a trusted leader rallying others around an important cause.

Now you are going to start your speech, the motion is: {motion}
